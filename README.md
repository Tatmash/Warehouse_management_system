# Warehouse_Management_System

## What is this project about?

This repository contains a course work assignment that I completed in 2019. I was required to add a class to an existing project. The program is a simplified version of a warehouse management system.

## What was given?

#### Coursework1Main class: 
This class makes use of some of the desired functionalities of the class Warehouse in the main method. I had the opportunity to test my implementation of the Warehouse class by running method Coursework1Main.main.

#### Article class:
An immutable class with very simple objects. Article objets have only a name and a price.

## What was I required to do?

I was required to write a class Warehouse. Its instances can store and
provide information about instances of a class Article, which has already been written.
A Warehouse object can tell us, e.g., the average price of its current articles,
the number of current articles, and so on. The specifics of the requirements are describen in the documentation.
